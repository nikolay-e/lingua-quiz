## License Compliance

It is your responsibility to understand and comply with the terms of the license under which you are
using the software. If your use case transitions from non-commercial to commercial, you must obtain
a commercial license before commencing commercial activities. Using the software under the wrong
license constitutes a breach of terms.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I start development with the non-commercial license and switch to a commercial license
later if my project becomes commercial?**  
A: Yes, absolutely. You can evaluate and develop under the non-commercial license. However, you
_must_ purchase and comply with the commercial license _before_ any commercial use begins (e.g.,
before launching a commercial product/service using the software, or deploying it internally in a
for-profit business).

**Q: What exactly constitutes "Commercial Use"?**  
A: Any use intended for or resulting in commercial advantage or monetary compensation. This
includes, but is not limited to: use within a for-profit company's internal operations, use in
products or services offered for a fee, use in connection with revenue-generating activities, or
embedding/redistributing the software as part of a commercial offering. If in doubt, assume the use
is commercial and contact us or consult the full license text.

**Q: How is commercial license pricing determined?**  
A: Pricing typically depends on the scope of use. Common models include per-developer seat (for
build-time use) or per-deployment instance/server/CPU core (for run-time use). Volume discounts and
enterprise licenses may also be available. Please contact us for specific pricing details relevant
to your situation.

**Q: Can I modify the software under the commercial license?**  
A: Yes, the commercial license grants you the right to modify the software for your own use within
the terms of the agreement.

**Q: If I modify the software under the commercial license, do I need to share my changes?**  
A: No. Unlike the non-commercial license, the commercial license does not require you to share your
source code modifications. You are permitted to distribute your product containing the modified
software in object code form only.

**Q: Does the commercial license include support?** A: The license grant itself is typically
perpetual. However, access to ongoing support (bug fixes, helpdesk) and updates/new versions usually
requires a separate, often subscription-based, maintenance and support agreement, details of which
would be in your Order Form.
