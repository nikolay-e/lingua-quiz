# LinguaQuiz üéØ

A full-stack language learning web application that helps users master vocabulary through an
intelligent spaced repetition system. Built with modern JavaScript and deployed on Kubernetes.

## Project Overview üöÄ

LinguaQuiz takes an approach to language learning by implementing an algorithm that adapts to user
performance. The application tracks word mastery in both directions (source ‚Üí target language and
vice versa) and intelligently selects which words to practice based on error frequency and mastery
level.

### Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), focusing on clean, maintainable code without framework
  overhead
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL with advanced SQL functions and triggers
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Nginx
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for comprehensive E2E testing

## Getting Started Locally (using Docker Compose) üê≥

These instructions will help you get a local copy of LinguaQuiz up and running on your machine using
Docker for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git:** To clone the repository.
- **Docker:** The containerization platform. Download from
  [Docker's website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- **Docker Compose:** Usually included with Docker Desktop. If not, follow the
  [official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the project:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nikolay-e/lingua-quiz.git
    cd lingua-quiz
    ```

2.  **Review and Modify Environment Variables:** The application uses a `.env` file in the project
    root for configuration. It's included in the repository with default values intended **only for
    local Docker Compose testing**.

    - **Important Note on Defaults:**

      - The default `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `JWT_SECRET` are public. They are suitable **only** for
        running the app locally with `docker compose up` for quick testing.
      - **Do not use these defaults outside of this specific local test setup** (e.g., in
        production, staging, or shared environments). For any deployment, use secure, unique secrets
        managed appropriately (e.g., via environment variables or secret management tools).

    - **Git Tip:** Since `.env` is tracked, if you modify it locally (e.g., ports), you can tell Git
      to ignore your local changes temporarily using `git update-index --skip-worktree .env` to
      avoid accidental commits. Use `--no-skip-worktree` to track changes again.

3.  **Build and Run the Core Application:** Navigate to the project's root directory (where
    `docker-compose.yml` is located) in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    docker compose up --build -d db backend frontend
    ```

    - `--build`: Forces Docker Compose to build the images (backend, frontend) based on their
      Dockerfiles before starting the containers. Recommended for the first run or after code
      changes.
    - `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

    The first time you run this, it might take a while as Docker downloads base images and builds
    your application images.

4.  **Accessing LinguaQuiz:** Once the containers are up and running (check `docker ps` or
    `docker compose ps`), you can access the application:
    - **Frontend:** Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.
    - **Backend API:** The API will be available at `http://localhost:9000`. Useful for development
      or API testing tools.

### Test Organization

LinguaQuiz has a comprehensive testing strategy with four distinct layers:

#### 1. Unit Tests

- Tests individual functions and components in isolation
- No external dependencies or network calls
- Fast execution for quick feedback loops
- Run with: `npm run test:unit`

#### 2. Integration Tests

- Tests interactions between related components
- Runs in the local environment with mocked dependencies
- Verifies code interfaces work correctly together
- Run with: `npm run test:integration`

#### 3. Component Tests

- Tests service boundaries and API contracts
- Uses containerized dependencies when needed
- Simulates real service interactions in isolated environments
- Run with: `npm run test:component`

#### 4. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- Tests complete user flows through the entire application
- Uses Playwright to automate browser interactions
- Verifies critical functionality from the user's perspective
- Run with: `npm run test:e2e`

### Running End-to-End (E2E) Tests

LinguaQuiz includes a comprehensive end-to-end test suite using Playwright that verifies critical
application flows including authentication, user sessions, and quiz functionality.

To run the E2E tests:

1. First, start the application:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. Then run the tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

#### Additional E2E Test Commands

- Run specific test suites:
  - Authentication tests: `npm run test:e2e:auth`
  - Quiz functionality: `npm run test:e2e:quiz`
- Run with faster quiz settings: `npm run test:e2e:fast`
- Run with debug mode: `npm run test:e2e:debug`
- Run in a specific browser: `npm run test:e2e:chromium`
- View the test report: `npm run test:report`

## Licensing üìù

LinguaQuiz is released under a **dual licence** model:

1. **Source-Available Non-Commercial License v2** (free) - For personal, educational, and non-profit
   use. Requires sharing source code of any derivatives.

2. **Proprietary Commercial License v2** (paid) - For business and commercial use. Allows
   object-code-only distribution.

This approach balances open usage for education/research with sustainable development through
commercial licensing. German law applies with venue in Berlin.

Please see [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md) for detailed information on both license options and to
determine which is appropriate for your use case.
