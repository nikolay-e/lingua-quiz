# LinguaQuiz üéØ

A full-stack language learning web application that helps users master vocabulary through an intelligent spaced repetition system. Built with modern
JavaScript and deployed on Kubernetes.

## Project Overview üöÄ

LinguaQuiz takes an approach to language learning by implementing an algorithm that adapts to user performance. The application tracks word mastery in
both directions (source ‚Üí target language and vice versa) and intelligently selects which words to practice based on error frequency and mastery
level.

### Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Frontend**: Svelte 4.0 with Vite build tool, deployed with Nginx
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, Flask, PostgreSQL with advanced SQL functions and triggers
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, GitHub Actions
- **Testing**: Playwright for comprehensive E2E testing (desktop & mobile)
- **Security**: JWT authentication, rate limiting, OWASP ZAP security scans
- **Monitoring**: Optional automated database backups to DigitalOcean Spaces

## Getting Started Locally (using Docker Compose) üê≥

These instructions will help you get a local copy of LinguaQuiz up and running on your machine using Docker for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git:** To clone the repository.
- **Docker:** The containerization platform. Download from [Docker's website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- **Docker Compose:** Usually included with Docker Desktop. If not, follow the
  [official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the project:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nikolay-e/lingua-quiz.git
    cd lingua-quiz
    ```

2.  **Review and Modify Environment Variables:** The application uses a `.env` file in the project root for configuration. It's included in the
    repository with default values intended **only for local Docker Compose testing**.

    - **Important Note on Defaults:**

      - The default `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `JWT_SECRET` are public. They are suitable **only** for running the app locally with `docker compose up`
        for quick testing.
      - **Do not use these defaults outside of this specific local test setup** (e.g., in production, staging, or shared environments). For any
        deployment, use secure, unique secrets managed appropriately (e.g., via environment variables or secret management tools).

    - **Git Tip:** Since `.env` is tracked, if you modify it locally (e.g., ports), you can tell Git to ignore your local changes temporarily using
      `git update-index --skip-worktree .env` to avoid accidental commits. Use `--no-skip-worktree` to track changes again.

3.  **Build and Run the Core Application:** Navigate to the project's root directory (where `docker-compose.yml` is located) in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    docker compose up --build -d db backend frontend
    ```

    - `--build`: Forces Docker Compose to build the images (backend, frontend) based on their Dockerfiles before starting the containers. Recommended
      for the first run or after code changes.
    - `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

    The first time you run this, it might take a while as Docker downloads base images and builds your application images.

4.  **Accessing LinguaQuiz:** Once the containers are up and running (check `docker ps` or `docker compose ps`), you can access the application:
    - **Frontend:** Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.
    - **Backend API:** The API will be available at `http://localhost:9000`. Useful for development or API testing tools.

### Running End-to-End (E2E) Tests

The E2E tests run in a separate service (`e2e-tests`) defined in the `docker-compose.yml`. To include this service when starting the application:

```bash
docker compose up --build e2e-tests
```

## Deployment Architecture üö¢

LinguaQuiz uses Kubernetes for cloud deployment, providing a scalable and maintainable infrastructure.

### Unified Helm Chart

The application is deployed using a single comprehensive Helm chart located in `./helm/lingua-quiz-app/`. This chart manages:

- Frontend deployment (Nginx serving static files)
- Backend API deployment
- PostgreSQL database (using StatefulSet with persistent volumes)
- Database migrations (automated via Kubernetes Jobs)
- Ingress configuration for routing traffic
- Secret management for sensitive data
- Optional database backup system (CronJob with MinIO client)

### Deployment Strategy

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Streamlined GitHub Actions workflow with parallel test and build jobs
- **Docker Images**: 
  - Frontend: Multi-stage build with Nginx
  - Backend: Optimized Node.js image with production dependencies
- **Kubernetes Resources**:
  - Deployments for frontend and backend with health checks
  - StatefulSet for PostgreSQL with persistent storage
  - Jobs for database migrations
  - Optional CronJob for automated backups
- **Ingress**: Single ingress resource routing to both frontend and API
- **TLS**: HTTPS encryption via cert-manager
- **Database Backups**: Optional automated backups to DigitalOcean Spaces

### Key Features

- **Environment Separation**: Supports multiple environments (production, staging) via namespace configuration
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive liveness, readiness, and startup probes
- **Resource Management**: Defined resource limits and requests for all containers
- **Database Migrations**: Automated migration system that runs before application startup
- **Backup System**: Optional backup functionality that can be enabled via Helm values

### Configuration

The Helm chart can be customized via values. Key configuration options:

```yaml
# Namespace configuration
namespace: lingua-quiz

# Enable/disable features
backup:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM

migrations:
  enabled: true
```

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy to production
helm upgrade --install lingua-quiz ./helm/lingua-quiz-app \
  --namespace lingua-quiz-production \
  --set secrets.jwtSecret=$JWT_SECRET \
  --set secrets.postgresPassword=$DB_PASSWORD

# Enable backups
helm upgrade lingua-quiz ./helm/lingua-quiz-app \
  --set backup.enabled=true \
  --set backup.spaces.accessKeyId=$SPACES_KEY \
  --set backup.spaces.secretKey=$SPACES_SECRET
```
