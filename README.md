# LinguaQuiz 🎯

A full-stack language learning web application that helps users master vocabulary through an intelligent spaced repetition system. Built with modern JavaScript and deployed on Kubernetes.

## Project Overview 🚀

LinguaQuiz takes an approach to language learning by implementing an algorithm that adapts to user performance. The application tracks word mastery in both directions (source → target language and vice versa) and intelligently selects which words to practice based on error frequency and mastery level.
