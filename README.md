# LinguaQuiz üéØ

A full-stack language learning web application that helps users master vocabulary through an intelligent spaced repetition system. Built with modern
JavaScript and deployed on Kubernetes.

## Project Overview üöÄ

LinguaQuiz takes an approach to language learning by implementing an algorithm that adapts to user performance. The application tracks word mastery in
both directions (source ‚Üí target language and vice versa) and intelligently selects which words to practice based on error frequency and mastery
level.

### Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), focusing on clean, maintainable code without framework overhead
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL with advanced SQL functions and triggers
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Nginx
- **Testing**: Jest, Playwright for cross-browser testing

## Getting Started Locally (using Docker Compose) üê≥

These instructions will help you get a local copy of LinguaQuiz up and running on your machine using Docker for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git:** To clone the repository.
- **Docker:** The containerization platform. Download from [Docker's website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- **Docker Compose:** Usually included with Docker Desktop. If not, follow the
  [official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the project:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nikolay-e/lingua-quiz.git
    cd lingua-quiz
    ```

2.  **Review and Modify Environment Variables:** The application uses a `.env` file in the project root for configuration. It's included in the
    repository with default values intended **only for local Docker Compose testing**.

    - **Important Note on Defaults:**

      - The default `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `JWT_SECRET` are public. They are suitable **only** for running the app locally with `docker compose up`
        for quick testing.
      - **Do not use these defaults outside of this specific local test setup** (e.g., in production, staging, or shared environments). For any
        deployment, use secure, unique secrets managed appropriately (e.g., via environment variables or secret management tools).

    - **Git Tip:** Since `.env` is tracked, if you modify it locally (e.g., ports), you can tell Git to ignore your local changes temporarily using
      `git update-index --skip-worktree .env` to avoid accidental commits. Use `--no-skip-worktree` to track changes again.

3.  **Build and Run the Core Application:** Navigate to the project's root directory (where `docker-compose.yml` is located) in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    docker compose up --build -d db backend frontend
    ```

    - `--build`: Forces Docker Compose to build the images (backend, frontend) based on their Dockerfiles before starting the containers. Recommended
      for the first run or after code changes.
    - `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

    The first time you run this, it might take a while as Docker downloads base images and builds your application images.

4.  **Accessing LinguaQuiz:** Once the containers are up and running (check `docker ps` or `docker compose ps`), you can access the application:
    - **Frontend:** Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.
    - **Backend API:** The API will be available at `http://localhost:9000`. Useful for development or API testing tools.

### Running End-to-End (E2E) Tests

The E2E tests run in a separate service (`e2e-tests`) defined in the `docker-compose.yml`. To include this service when starting the application:

```bash
docker compose up --build e2e-tests
```

## Deployment Architecture üö¢

LinguaQuiz uses Kubernetes for cloud deployment, providing a scalable and maintainable infrastructure.

### Unified Helm Chart

The application is deployed using a single unified Helm chart located in `./helm/lingua-quiz-app/`. This chart manages:

- Frontend deployment (Nginx serving static files)
- Backend API deployment
- PostgreSQL database (using StatefulSet)
- Ingress configuration for both services
- Secret management

> **Note**: Legacy Helm charts in `packages/backend/helm/` are deprecated and will be removed in a future update.

### Deployment Strategy

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions automates the build, test, and deployment process
- **Docker Images**: Frontend and backend are containerized separately
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Both components are deployed to Kubernetes
- **Ingress**: Configured to route traffic to frontend and API endpoints
- **TLS**: HTTPS encryption for all endpoints
- **Database Backups**: Automated backups using CronJobs

- GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`
- Helm chart templates in `./helm/lingua-quiz-app/templates/`
